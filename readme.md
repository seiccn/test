    Description of the project (2-3+ sentences).
    My project is a pizza calculator that generates pizza poems and also generates users. You may use the project to generate a random user or a own pizza creation and a pem for the pizza for your client. 
    Demo information: If you attend your section to do an in-person demo, make a note of this. If you opt to do the Jing screencast demo, include the link here.

    Any details the instructor or TA needs to know, for example, test credentials.
    A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project. See Student Responsibilities for more details on avoiding code plagiarism.
    I wrote everything by myself to be on the safe side.
